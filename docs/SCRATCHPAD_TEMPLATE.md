## 🎯 Current Objective

## 🧠 Analysis & Plan

1.  [ ] Analyze `src/helpers/sync/pullData.ts` to understand current logic.
2.  [ ] Draft the new conflict resolution function below.
3.  [ ] Update the tests in `__tests__/useSync.test.ts`.
4.  [ ] Apply changes to the actual file.

## 🚧 Code Drafts & Snippets

```typescript
// Draft: New conflict resolution helper
// Constraint Check: Are we using raw PouchDB types? Yes.
function resolveConflict(localDoc: PouchDB.Core.Document<Filament>, remoteDoc: Filament) {
  // Logic goes here...
}
```

## ✅ Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] No Tailwind: Am I using React Bootstrap components?
- [ ] Local-First: Does this work without an internet connection?
- [ ] Type Safety: Are there any `any` types that need fixing?
- [ ] Tests: Have I planned how to verify this change?
